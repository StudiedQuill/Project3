        <h2 class="audioWave">Elementary</h2>
        <p>In elementary I learned music through the music classes we had everyday.</p>
        <p>Though I don't remember when we did everything I do remember what were the instruments we got to learn and play.</p>
        <p>I learned how to play conga drums, keyboard, violin, and recorder</p>
        <p>I learned one more instrument in 5th grade which the one that I used in band, the clarinet.</p>
        <p>I learned how to play clarinet and had concerts which probably were not good at all but hey we all start somewhere.</p>

        <h2 class="audioWave">Middle School</h2>
        <p>In middle school there weren't many music classes except for band and choir. For band you already had to be in it 5th grade to be in the middle school band.</p>
        <p>In band I played the clarinet since that's the one I started with in elementary</p>
        <p>There were three bands, one for each year and we moved up as we moved up in grade.</p>
        <p>I kept practicing and learning how to become a better musician. This payed off in 8th grade when I became the best clarinet in the whole school.</p>
        <p>The concerts got better and better all the way till 8th grade where we played the best concert we had played at that point. It was a great way to end the middle school year.</p>

      <section id="highSchool">
        <h2 class="audioWave">High School</h2>
        <p>The change from middle school band and high school band was great. There were more bands and way more kids in one band than I had ever been in.</p>
        <p>Due to how many kids there were, a lot of people had the same instruments but there were a few instruments that almost no one played if even that.</p>
        <p>That was the case with the Bass Clarinet which I switched to playing in 9th grade. At first it was a little troublesome to get used to it but once I got the hang of it, it was fine</p>
        <p>Since the notes were the same as the clarinet and so were the fingerings it wasn't hard to play but the air needed to play good low and high notes was a lot more than a clarinets.</p>
        <p>Not only this but at first my instrument was broken but I thought it was just I who couldn't play it yet so I didn't say anything until I had a part that needed the high notes and was called on</p>
        <p>I made friends in band and together we got together. Until Covid happened and band was kind of put on hold for a whole year.</p>
        <p>I was a sophomore when it happened and I almost quit band due to how bad it was but I'm extremely glad I stuck with it all the way.</p>
        <p>Once we got back in person, band become such a big part of my time at school, so much that I managed to get into the best band my senior year.</p>
        <p>This was the best year for me since I was the best Bass Clarinet there but most importantly because the music we played and the amount of band events we attended</p>
        <p>I managed to get two top places for an event and had the best final concerts. This whole year was memorable and so much fun.</p>
        <p>Sadly I am no longer in band but I still plan on playing on my clarinet whenever I get the chance to.</p>
