        <p>So Naruto is one of my favorite anime that I have seen(Almost beat by Dr.Stone)</p>
        <p>It has really great character development, story, and is always a fun watch.</p>
        <p>The battle scenes, for the most part, are thrilling and exciting</p>
        <p>It has a lot episodes which means a lot of challanges to overcome. This includes having to fight agaisnt a lot of strong bosses such as Pain and Madara Uchiha</p>
        <p>My favorite characters are:</p>
      <div class="center">
        <p class="audioWave">Sasuke Uchiha</p>
